# FinanceAI
Let's learn to finance with our friend LLM

# Description of LLM
Uses open-webui as our web framework base

Users will be able to easily prompt the online GUI to interact with the model, which gives quick, relevant, and easy-to-understand solutions to their questions. Users will be able to ask for feedback on budgets, loans, long-term investments, and other topics related to personal finance.

We will train the model on finance data related to personal finance education and make it available to the users. We want to ensure that the web interface is user friendly, that we have high accuracy to our models, and that we have relevant solutions. The questions that the user will be able to receive answers to will be related to concepts such as credit cards, credit scores, budgeting, loans, mortgages, investing in stocks, and more. We will inform the user that the LLM is simply providing suggestions and explanations about personal finance and that the user should review all information with a personal financial advisor before taking any actions.
